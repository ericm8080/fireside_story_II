		It was a dark & stormy night, actually just downright plain cold!!
		Hi Ryan! Hope this note finds you doing well this January.
		I have been wanting to contact you but have waited until I had time to do so via some GIT
		practice like we had discussed! Lol.
	</p>
	<p style=“color:green”>Sorry for down and dirty styling but I just wanted to get this started at least.
		1) If you are ok with some push 	and pull practice with this repo that would be great.
		I just need some practice learning the routine with other people joining code.</p>
	<p style=“color:green”>2) Do you still have free time to visit the humble photo studio down in the city?
		If so we can do either Wednesday this week or Tue, Wed, Maybe Fri next week.</p>
	<p>3) Would you like to get together to discuss code?  Coffee somewhere or something.  -OVER-</p>
