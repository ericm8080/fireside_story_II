        It was a dark & stormy night, actually just downright plain cold!!
		Hi Ryan! Hope this note finds you doing well this January.
		I have been wanting to contact you but have waited until I had time to do so via some GIT
		practice like we had discussed! Lol.</p>
	<p style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;">
		Sorry for down and dirty styling but I just wanted to get this started at least.
		1) If you are ok with some push 	and pull practice with this repo that would be great.
		I just need some practice learning the routine with other people joining code.</p>

        2) Do you still have free time to visit the humble photo studio down in the city?
		If so we can do either Wednesday this week or Tue, Wed, Maybe Fri next week.</p>

        3) Would you like to get together to discuss code?  Coffee somewhere or something.  -OVER-</p>
    <p> Hey Eric, I created a gitignore file on my side I'm not sure if that is always needed when you
        first import a project.  I have been working on the android class.  I would like to check out the
    studio.  I am available later today if this is the right Friday. -OVER-</p>

        Hi Ryan.  I hope you received my email note about the crazy few weeks I have had.  Sorry for the delay.
        This is great practice for both my git and html.  I get so busy with Android and framework and DB weeks
        turn into months that I am away from these topics.  Hope this note finds you well.  I will send
        another email note about coming by the studio either 2/23 or 2/26-2/28.  Its a good time because boss is
        away on business trip.  But not sure how often you check inbox, so if you get this later just let me know
        when is a good time for you. -OVER-</p>
